<p align="left"> PROJECT 1: To create this webpage, I took the last text message that was sent to me and searched each piece of the sentence on Google Images individually to generate an abstract poem accompanied by seemingly unrelated pictures, even though they are connected. </p>

This game has 6 alternate endings, all of which lead to an unfortunate result. This game is unwinnable, speaking to the fact that no matter how safe you try to be, you can still get COVID. </p>
